# Example app

We used geographic data from the
[ONS linked data portal](http://statistics.data.gov.uk/) and sampled &
converted housing datasets from the
[London Data Store](http://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/average-house-prices-borough)
to RDF in order to build heatmap visualizations of the London housing
situation:

This heatmap shows average property sale prices per borough in 2013/14:

![London house prices 2013/14](assets/ldn-heatmap.jpg)

This heatmap is based on the number of property sales, showing a clear bias in the south east:

## CLJS build w/ advanced optimizations

To build the CLJS examples with advanced optimizations, uncomment the lines with `:optimizations` & `:pretty-print` from the `project.clj` file for the relevant build profile(s). Then compile the source with:

```
lein do clean, cljsbuild once <insert-build-profile-id>
```
