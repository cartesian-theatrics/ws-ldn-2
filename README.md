## CLJS build w/ advanced optimizations

To build the CLJS examples with advanced optimizations, uncomment the lines with `:optimizations` & `:pretty-print` from the `project.clj` file for the relevant build profile(s). Then compile the source with:

```
lein do clean, cljsbuild once <insert-build-profile-id>
```
